# Release Drafter Workflow
#
# This workflow maintains a draft release with auto-generated release notes.
# It runs on every push to main and when PRs are opened/merged.
#
# The draft release is updated automatically based on PR titles and labels.
# When you're ready to release, the prepare-release.yml workflow will create
# the actual release with proper versioning.
